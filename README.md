*The Advice Shop Website*

This is an Example Site for Web Design (CP1406, CP3402) at JCU

First created for the 2015 class in Townsville, by Lindsay Ward

Demonstrates a few useful things like:

- Navigation highlights the current page
- **SQLite** database integration (just read) for quotes
- List of quotes -> link to individual quotes
- Super-basic "login" form demonstrates PHP **sessions** 
- Login form processing page redirects (never shows in browser)
